|     You use a magnetic or noncollinear calculation, but did not specify     |
|     the initial magnetic moment with the MAGMOM tag. Note that a            |
|     default of 3.472e-3 will be used for all atoms. This ferromagnetic      |
|     setup may break the symmetry of the crystal, in particular it may       |
|     rule out finding an antiferromagnetic solution. Thence, we              |
|     recommend setting the initial magnetic moment manually or verifying     |
|     carefully that this magnetic setup is desired.                          |
|                                                                             |

|     For optimal performance we recommend to set                             |
|       NCORE = 2 up to number-of-cores-per-socket                            |
|     NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).      |
|     This setting can greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.       |
|     The default, NCORE=1 might be grossly inefficient on modern             |
|     multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines. Do your        |
|     own testing! More info at https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/NCORE      |
|     Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA                |
|     calculations (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested      |
|     yet).                                                                   |
|                                                                             |
