start parameters for this Run (automatic defaults, hence not often required)

electronic optimization

  ALGO  =  VeryFast  # alorithm for electron optimization, can be also FAST or ALL
  NELM   = 60        # of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
  EDIFF  = 1E-06     # stopping-criterion for ELM
! broadening and DOS related values; this works almost always
  SIGMA  =    0.05;
  ISMEAR =  0   # Warning: Avoid using ISMEAR>0 for semiconductors and insulators ! broadening in eV, -4-tet -1-fermi 0-gaus

ionic relaxation
  EDIFFG =  -1E-02   # stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
  NSW    =  20       # number of steps for IOM
  IBRION =  2        # CG for ions, often 1 (RMM-DISS) is faster
  POTIM  =  .5       # step for ionic-motion (for MD in fs)
  ISIF   =  3 #todo lookup default: 0

performance optimization
  KPAR   =    4      # make 4 groups, each group working on one set of k-points
  NCORE  =    4      # one orbital handled by 4 cores
  LREAL  =    A      # real space projection; slightly less accurate but faster
