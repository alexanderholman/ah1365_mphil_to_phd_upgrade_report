> if its **** it's because [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazonprime) removed [Baywatch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096542/); so I had to write this up to [Manifest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8421350/) like someone who doesn't have access to Baywatch...

Some of the more interesting figures:

#### Top N Overlap

#### Spearman Correlation of All Comparisons

#### Spearman Correlation of Perfect Alloys

#### Kendall Correlation of All Comparisons
![Figure 1](./analysis/plots/results_kendall_all_comparisons_both.png)

#### Kendall Correlation of All "Valid" Comparisons

A note: "valid" here means that the DFT relaxed and computed formation energy is less than 1eV/atom.

#### Compute Time Comparison
