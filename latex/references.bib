               theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the
               Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative
               method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization,
               which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively
               large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing
               methods for the charge density including a new special
               `preconditioning' optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d)
               conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free

               have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package

                  Recently, several equivariant message passing neural networks
                  (MPNNs) have been shown to outperform models built using
                  other approaches in terms of accuracy. However, most MPNNs

                  framework of a generalized Ising model, shows that the
                  diamond structure is the most stable under ambient
                  conditions, but hexagonal modifications are close to the
                  phase boundary, especially for Si. Our band-structure

                  leads to type-I heterocrystalline interfaces between Ge
                  polytypes, where electrons and holes can be trapped in the
                  layer with the higher hexagonality. In contrast, the energy
                  shift of the indirect conduction band minima of Si polytypes
                  is rather weak, leading to delocalization of excited
                  electrons at interfaces, while only holes can localize in the

               forward a method for calculating the field of anatom containing
               many electrons. Each orbit---to borrow a metaphor from the old
               quantum theory---is related to a wave-function $\Psi$ which
               obeys Schr{\"o}dinger's equation. The potential energy used in
               this equation is due partly to the field of the nucleus, and
               partly to the fields of the electrons in the other orbits. The
               latter are calculated upon Schr{\"o}dinger's interpretation of
               the wave-function, that |$\Psi$|2 is the density of charge,
               measured in electronic charges per unit volume. It is not the

               contrast, DFT modelling of explicit interfaces in batteries
               arguably lacks universally adopted methodology and needs further
               conceptual development. In this paper, we focus on solid-solid
               interfaces, which are ubiquitous not just in all-solid state
               batteries; liquid-electrolyte-based batteries often rely on

               potentials, electric fields at interfaces, and kinetic stability
               with respect to parasitic reactions. The examples emphasize
               three key challenges: (1) the ``dirty'' nature of most battery

               essential to exploit their electronic and magnetic properties.
               In this work, the electronic and magnetic properties of Si/Ge
               monolayer (ML) on a LaO-terminated LaTiO3 (LTO) or
               LiO-terminated Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO) surface, at La-, O- and
               Li-top sites systems were studied through the Density Functional
               Theory. Our results show that the system has an
               antiferromagnetic order when the Si-ML is on the O-top site of
               the LTO surface; and ferromagnetic when the Si-ML is on the
               O-top site of the LLTO surface. All the remaining Si adsorption
               cases are ferrimagnetic systems. When the Ge ML is placed at the
               La-top and O-top sites on the LTO surface, the resulting systems
               exhibit ferrimagnetism. In contrast, the Ge-ML on the LLTO
               surface shows ferromagnetism, regardless of the adsorption site.
               The adsorption energy values show that the most favorable site
               to place the Si/Ge ML on the LLTO perovskite surface is at the
               O-top site. These results display that Si/Ge semiconductor

               dichalcogenides (TMDCs), opened a new route towards realisation
               of optoelectronic devices with unique characteristics. In
               contrast to van der Waals vertical heterostructures, the
               covalent bonding at the interface between subsystems in LHs is
               strong, such that the morphology of the interface, which can be

               quantum theory, involving a solution of the wave equation in
               many-dimensional space, is far too complicated to be
               practicable. One must therefore resort to approximate methods.
               The best of these is Hartree's method of the self-consistent
               field. Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to
               deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still
               simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas'
               atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a
               perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the
               region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase

               of this faceted morphology remain a challenge, especially for
               systems where irrational orientation relationships (ORs) between
               two phases and irrational interface orientations (IOs) are
               preferred. In terms of structural singularities, this work
               suggests an integrated framework, which possibly encompasses all
               candidates of faceted interfaces. The structural singularities
               are identified from a matching pattern, a dislocation structure
               and/or a ledge structure. The resultant singular interfaces have
               discrete IOs, described with low-index g's (rational
               orientations) and/or $\Delta$g's (either rational or irrational
               orientations). Various existing models are grouped according to
               their determined results regarding the OR and IO, and the links
               between the models are clarified in the integrated framework.
               Elimination of defect types as far as possible in a dominant
               singular interface often exerts a central restriction on the OR.
               An irrational IO is usually due to the elimination of
               dislocations in one direction, i.e., an O-line interface.
               Analytical methods using both three-dimensional and
               two-dimensional models for quantitative determinations of O-line
               interfaces are reviewed, and a detailed example showing the

               association between structural singularities and local energy
               minima is verified by atomistic calculations of interfacial
               energies in fcc/bcc alloys where it is found that the calculated

  abstract  = "Volumetric crystal structure indexing and orientation mapping
               are key data processing steps for virtually any quantitative
               study of spatial correlations between the local chemical
               composition features and the microstructure of a material. For
               electron and X-ray diffraction methods it is possible to develop
               indexing tools which compare measured and analytically computed
               patterns to decode the structure and relative orientation within
               local regions of interest. Consequently, a number of numerically
               efficient and automated software tools exist to solve the above
               characterization tasks. For atom-probe tomography (APT)
               experiments, however, the strategy of making comparisons between
               measured and analytically computed patterns is less robust
               because many APT data sets contain substantial noise. Given that
               sufficiently general predictive models for such noise remain
               elusive, crystallography tools for APT face several limitations:
               their robustness to noise is limited, and therefore so too is
               their capability to identify and distinguish different crystal
               structures and orientations. In addition, the tools are
               sequential and demand substantial manual interaction. In
               combination, this makes robust uncertainty quantification with
               automated high-throughput studies of the latent crystallographic
               information a difficult task with APT data. To improve the
               situation, the existing methods are reviewed and how they link
               to the methods currently used by the electron and X-ray
               diffraction communities is discussed. As a result of this, some
               of the APT methods are modified to yield more robust descriptors
               of the atomic arrangement. Also reported is how this enables the
               development of an open-source software tool for strong scaling
               and automated identification of a crystal structure, and the
               mapping of crystal orientation in nanocrystalline APT data sets

  author    = "Hartree, D R",
  abstract  = "The paper is concerned with the practical determination of the
               characteristic values and functions of the wave equation of
               Schrodinger for a non-Coulomb central field, for which the
               potential is given as a function of the distance r from the
               nucleus.The method used is to integrate a modification of the
               equation outwards from initial conditions corresponding to a
               solution finite at r = 0, and inwards from initial conditions
               corresponding to a solution zero at r = $\infty$, with a trial
               value of the parameter (the energy) whose characteristic values
               are to be determined; the values of this parameter for which the
               two solutions fit at some convenient intermediate radius are the
               characteristic values required, and the solutions which so fit
               are the characteristic functions (§§ 2, 10).Modifications of the
               wave equation suitable for numerical work in different parts of
               the range of r are given (§§ 2, 3, 5), also exact equations for
               the variation of a solution with a variation in the potential or
               of the trial value of the energy (§ 4); the use of these
               variation equations in preference to a complete new integration
               of the equation for every trial change of field or of the energy
               parameter avoids a great deal of numerical work.For the range of
               r where the deviation from a Coulomb field is inappreciable,
               recurrence relations between different solutions of the wave
               equations which are zero at r = $\infty$, and correspond to
               terms with different values of the effective and subsidiary
               quantum numbers, are given and can be used to avoid carrying out
               the integration in each particular case (§§ 6, 7).Formulae for
               the calculation of first order perturbations due to the
               relativity variation of mass and to the spinning electron are
               given (§ 8).The method used for integrating the equations

               in such a system is often under strong influence of competing
               orderings linked to those crystals. However, how such
               competition affects crystal nucleation and ordering toward the
               final crystalline state is largely unknown. This is primarily
               because the competition takes place locally and thus is masked
               by large positional fluctuations. We develop a unique method to
               correctly identify local symmetries by removing their
               distortions due to positional fluctuations. This allows us to

               which is computed by electrostatics from all the charges of the
               system, positive and negative, corrected by the removal of an
               exchange charge, equal in magnitude to one electron, surrounding
               the electron whose motion is being investigated. By forming a
               weighted mean of the exchange charges, weighted and averaged
               over the various electronic wave functions at a given point of
               space, we set up an average potential field in which we can

               understanding of the microstructure--property relations of
               advanced high-strength steels (AHSS). These alloys constitute a
               class of high-strength, formable steels that are designed mainly
               as sheet products for the transportation sector. AHSS have often
               very complex and hierarchical microstructures consisting of
               ferrite, austenite, bainite, or martensite matrix or of duplex
               or even multiphase mixtures of these constituents, sometimes
               enriched with precipitates. This complexity makes it challenging
               to establish reliable and mechanism-based
               microstructure--property relationships. A number of excellent
               studies already exist about the different types of AHSS (such as
               dual-phase steels, complex phase steels, transformation-induced
               plasticity steels, twinning-induced plasticity steels, bainitic
               steels, quenching and partitioning steels, press hardening
               steels, etc.) and several overviews appeared in which their
               engineering features related to mechanical properties and
               forming were discussed. This article reviews recent progress in
               the understanding of microstructures and alloy design in this
               field, placing particular attention on the deformation and
               strain hardening mechanisms of Mn-containing steels that utilize
               complex dislocation substructures, nanoscale precipitation
               patterns, deformation-driven transformation, and twinning
               effects. Recent developments on microalloyed nanoprecipitation
               hardened and press hardening steels are also reviewed. Besides
               providing a critical discussion of their microstructures and
               properties, vital features such as their resistance to hydrogen
               embrittlement and damage formation are also evaluated. We also
               present latest progress in advanced characterization and
               modeling techniques applied to AHSS. Finally, emerging topics
               such as machine learning, through-process simulation, and
               additive manufacturing of AHSS are discussed. The aim of this
               viewpoint is to identify similarities in the deformation and
               damage mechanisms among these various types of advanced steels
               and to use these observations for their further development and
               maturation.",

               environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a

               materials, solid-solid interfaces play a key role in many
               technological applications. Understanding and predicting
               properties of these complex systems present an ongoing and
               increasingly important challenge. Over the last few decades
               computer simulation of interfaces has become vastly more
               powerful and sophisticated. However, theoretical interface
               screening remains based on largely heuristic methods and is
               strongly biased to systems that are amenable to modelling within
               constrained periodic cell approaches. Here we present an
               unconstrained and generally applicable non-periodic screening
               approach for systematic exploration of material's interfaces
               based on extracting and aligning disks from periodic reference

               two interacting surfaces. The resultant detailed and

  abstract = "Forming a hetero-interface is a materials-design strategy that
              can access an astronomically large phase space. However, the
              immense phase space necessitates a high-throughput approach for
              an optimal interface design. Here we introduce a high-throughput
              computational framework, InterMatch, for efficiently predicting
              charge transfer, strain, and superlattice structure of an
              interface by leveraging the databases of individual bulk
              materials. Specifically, the algorithm reads in the lattice
              vectors, density of states, and the stiffness tensors for each
              material in their isolated form from the Materials Project. From
              these bulk properties, InterMatch estimates the interfacial
              properties. We benchmark InterMatch predictions for the charge
              transfer against experimental measurements and supercell
              density-functional theory calculations. We then use InterMatch to
              predict promising interface candidates for doping transition
              metal dichalcogenide MoSe2. Finally, we explain experimental
              observation of factor of 10 variation in the supercell
              periodicity within a few microns in graphene/$\alpha$-RuCl3 by
              exploring low energy superlattice structures as a function of
              twist angle using InterMatch. We anticipate our open-source
              InterMatch algorithm accelerating and guiding ever-growing
              interfacial design efforts. Moreover, the interface database

               thousands of MOFs carried out using multiple density functional
               approximations. Compared to more accurate hybrid functionals, we
               find that the widely used PBE generalized gradient approximation
               (GGA) functional severely underpredicts MOF band gaps in a
               largely systematic manner for semi-conductors and insulators
               without magnetic character. However, an even larger and less
               predictable disparity in the band gap prediction is present for
               MOFs with open-shell 3d transition metal cations. With regards
               to partial atomic charges, we find that different density
               functional approximations predict similar charges overall,

               from the metal centers and onto the ligand environments compared

               predictions across the transition metals for two leading MLFF
               models: a kernel-based atomic cluster expansion method
               implemented using sparse Gaussian processes (FLARE), and an
               equivariant message-passing neural network (NequIP). Early
               transition metals present higher relative errors and are more
               difficult to learn relative to late platinum- and coinage-group
               elements, and this trend persists across model architectures.
               Trends in complexity of interatomic interactions for different
               metals are revealed via comparison of the performance of
               representations with different many-body order and angular
               resolution. Using arguments based on perturbation theory on the
               occupied and unoccupied d states near the Fermi level, we
               determine that the large, sharp d density of states both above

  abstract  = "Density-functional theory with extended Hubbard functionals (DFT
               + U + V) provides a robust framework to accurately describe
               complex materials containing transition-metal or rare-earth
               elements. It does so by mitigating self-interaction errors
               inherent to semi-local functionals which are particularly
               pronounced in systems with partially-filled d and f electronic
               states. However, achieving accuracy in this approach hinges upon
               the accurate determination of the on-site U and inter-site V
               Hubbard parameters. In practice, these are obtained either by
               semi-empirical tuning, requiring prior knowledge, or, more
               correctly, by using predictive but expensive first-principles
               calculations. Here, we present a machine learning model based on
               equivariant neural networks which uses atomic occupation
               matrices as descriptors, directly capturing the electronic
               structure, local chemical environment, and oxidation states of
               the system at hand. We target here the prediction of Hubbard
               parameters computed self-consistently with iterative
               linear-response calculations, as implemented in
               density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and structural
               relaxations. Remarkably, when trained on data from 12 materials
               spanning various crystal structures and compositions, our model
               achieves mean absolute relative errors of 3\% and 5\% for
               Hubbard U and V parameters, respectively. By circumventing
               computationally expensive DFT or DFPT self-consistent protocols,
               our model significantly expedites the prediction of Hubbard
               parameters with negligible computational overhead, while
               approaching the accuracy of DFPT. Moreover, owing to its robust
               transferability, the model facilitates accelerated materials

               structure has dominated the electronics industry for more than
               half a century. However, cubic silicon (Si), germanium (Ge) and
               SiGe alloys are all indirect-bandgap semiconductors that cannot
               emit light efficiently. The goal1 of achieving efficient light
               emission from group-IV materials in silicon technology has been
               elusive for decades2-6. Here we demonstrate efficient light
               emission from direct-bandgap hexagonal Ge and SiGe alloys. We
               measure a sub-nanosecond, temperature-insensitive radiative
               recombination lifetime and observe an emission yield similar to
               that of direct-bandgap group-III-V semiconductors. Moreover, we
               demonstrate that, by controlling the composition of the
               hexagonal SiGe alloy, the emission wavelength can be
               continuously tuned over a broad range, while preserving the
               direct bandgap. Our experimental findings are in excellent
               quantitative agreement with ab initio theory. Hexagonal SiGe
               embodies an ideal material system in which to combine electronic
               and optoelectronic functionalities on a single chip, opening the

  abstract  = "Abstract Broadband photodetectors and photovoltaic devices are
               crucial components in various optoelectronic applications,
               spanning self-powered photodetectors, solar energy harvesting
               and optical imaging systems, where optical sensitivity and
               efficient charge carrier generation are paramount. Two
               dimensional (2D) materials can be used to form p-n junctions for
               these applications, without crystal lattice or grain boundary
               constraints, which are common issues in bulk semiconductors.
               However, a key challenge lies in developing 2D heterojunctions
               that can efficiently harvest light across a broad spectrum while
               maintaining high charge separation. Here, we report
               heterojunctions of iron phosphorus trisulfide (FePS3) and
               molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) as the p- and n-type materials,
               respectively, demonstrating broadband photoresponse and
               photovoltaic behaviour. The results reveal that the FePS3-MoS2
               heterojunctions form a Type-II band alignment, which not only
               enhances charge separation at the interface but also leads to
               faster relaxation times as compared to the individual materials.
               As such, enabling a robust photovoltaic and photoresponse across
               the visible spectrum. Notably, the heterojunctions exhibit a
               short-circuit current density of ~0.29 mA/cm² under visible
               light and outperform similar two-material heterostructures.
               These heterojunctions also demonstrate potential for translation
               onto flexible platforms by maintaining a comparable
               optoelectronic performance. This opens up opportunities for
               engineering flexible and self-driven optoelectronic devices,
               which is beneficial for smart wearable technology.",

               interactions remain one of the greatest challenges for atomistic

               describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic
               rearrangements, the more accurate ab initio molecular dynamics
               suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time
               and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study
               technologically relevant phenomena. Here we present the Crystal
               Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), a graph neural
               network-based machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) that
               models the universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is
               pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses and magnetic
               moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which
               consists of over 10 years of density functional theory
               calculations of more than 1.5 million inorganic structures. The
               explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn

               enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic
               degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of

               molecular dynamics in LixMnO2, the finite temperature phase

               highlight the significance of charge information for capturing
               appropriate chemistry and provide insights into ionic systems
