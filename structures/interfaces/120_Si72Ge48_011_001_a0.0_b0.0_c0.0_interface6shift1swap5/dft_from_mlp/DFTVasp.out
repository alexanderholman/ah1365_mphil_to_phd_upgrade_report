|     You use a magnetic or noncollinear calculation, but did not specify     |
|     the initial magnetic moment with the MAGMOM tag. Note that a            |
|     default of 8.333e-3 will be used for all atoms. This ferromagnetic      |
|     setup may break the symmetry of the crystal, in particular it may       |
|     rule out finding an antiferromagnetic solution. Thence, we              |
|     recommend setting the initial magnetic moment manually or verifying     |
|     carefully that this magnetic setup is desired.                          |
